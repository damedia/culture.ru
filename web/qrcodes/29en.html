Golitsin ran the estate. “Caprice” – is a small one-floor living house inspirited by regular garden monbijou-pavilions traditional for the XVIII century. 
 The library is a graceful garden building, constructed by I. Petondi, the Italian architect. After fire of 1829, which destroyed wooden wings of the library, central stone pavilion with small stepped dome preserved, it had wonderful interior decoration with white columns and fretwork on the blue wall background.  As time went on the owners started to use it as a “Tea house”.
 In 1819 prince N. Yusupov rebuilt “Caprice” and decorated it with big ionic order portico which embraced both floors of the building.  In the central part of the ground floor there was a large hall. The parlor, bedroom and servant's room situated in the right wing of the building, on the left side there were a bedroom and a kitchen. On the top floor there were a hall and a parlor. The interior was was decorated with paintings, marble sculptures, mirrors and porcelain from the prince’s collections.
 In XIX century the “Garden” in front of the“Caprice” had a regular design and was decorated with 35 vases, busts, herms and statues. In the center of a flower facade there was a marble copy of &quot;&quot;Cupids fashioning a bow out of the club of Hercules” statue by French sculptor E. Bushardon.
 In the bosquet to the south from the “Caprice” N. Golitsin built a summer riding hall. During the restoration of 1980s it's elbowed pathway was restored.</div>
