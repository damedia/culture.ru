Present state of the terrace system was finished during the reconstruction of  1829.
Wealth of statues (there are nearly 200 of them) contributes to the unique finery of the Arkhangelskoye park. The majority of the statues are located on the terraces. The statues were brought from foreign countries or made in the Campioni's workshop in Moscow and Triscornia's workshops in St. Petersburgh in the first third of the XIX century, the marble for the statues was bought by Nikolay Yusupov in Carrara.
 The statuaries “Hercules and Antaeus” (made by unknown master after Stephano Moderna's terracotta, after model by Michelangelo) and “Menelaus supporting the body of Patroclus” are assembled on the grass of the top terrace. Herms and busts of antique gods are located along the paths. The parapet wall is decorated with allegoric figures statues, you can also find the copy of the famous “Wounded Amazon” there. The tops of balustrades of the sustaining walls are decorated with marble vases. Statues of dogs, lion and lioness guard the stairs.</div>
