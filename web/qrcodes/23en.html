Western and Eastern “ruin arches”.

Present state of the terrace system was fulfilled during the reconstruction of  1829.
Wealth of statues (there are nearly 200 of them) contributes to the unique finery of the Arkhangelskoye park. The majority of the statue are located on the terraces. The statues were brought from foreign countries or made in the Campioni's workshop in Moscow and Triscornia's workshops in St. Petersburgh in the first third of the XIX century, the marble for the statues was bought by Nikolay Yusupov in Carrara.
 The lower terrace is decorated with the statues (the beginning of  XIX centure) made after antique originals: a pair of &quot;&quot;Cupids fashioning a bow out of the club of Hercules&quot;&quot;, “Apollo Belvedere” and “Diana of Versailles”. The “ Cupid and delphinus” fountain by D. Giaromello is located in the middle of the terrace. A lion (heraldic animal of Yusupov's colors) is presented in numerous sculptural images.
 The main stairs with two branching away and  concurring flights leads from the Lower terrace to the Big parterre. It's decorated with parts of the world's allegories (statues of Africa, Europe, Asia and America). A pair of “Egyptian” herms is guarding the entrance to the cavern, where the statue of Medici Venus is hidden.
 Sustaining wall's balustrade which is nearly 150 meters long is decorated with pairs of  antique commanders, rulers, gods and heroes's busts. “Ruined” arches of crude stone are placed on the sides of  the Lower terrace. There is a  shadowed pathway with ramped approaches which leads to the Palace around sunny terraces.</div>
