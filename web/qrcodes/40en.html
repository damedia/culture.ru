Yusupov served as director of Imperial theaters, he was closely connected with theater industry of that period and organized several performances for Italian troupes in Moscow. In 1792 he invited famous Italian theater artist and decorator P. Gonzaga to visit Russia. Gonzaga later became a decorator of the Imperial theaters in St.Petersburgh.
 In 1817-1818 in the western part of the Arkhangelskoye  the wooden theater is constructed on the old stone foundation for manege which originally was made for a so-called “decoration performance”. This type of performances was popular in Europe in the middle and the second part of the XVIII century. It was built by Osip Ivanov's workshop, supervised by a bondman-architector Vasily Strijakov, he made a range of modifications in the original project. Moscow architects Evgraf Tyurin and Stepan Melnikov also participated in construction.
 In December 1817 joiner Fedor Zaharov have constructed and installed side-scenes machines, and in January 1818 local bond fitters and joiners designed details for scene mechanics and hooks for lamps.
In May 1818 the first part of decorations was delivered from St. Petersburg, they were installed and scene mechanics was fixed. All in all Pietro Gonzaga designed 10 changeable decorations and curtain.
 We do not know how the performances took place. Yusupov family used theater to storage and to perform the decorations. Only 4 decorations and the curtain have been preserved to present day: “Jail”, “Tavern” (or “Izba”), “Malachit hall” (or “Marble gallery”), “Roman temple” (or “Rotunda”). Today from the copies made by bond artist we can find out how did other decorations look like. At present moment the restoration of the theater is mostly finished.
In summer  you can take part in a specialized excursion program and visit the theater  on Saturdays and Sundays.</div>
