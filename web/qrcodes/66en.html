 Constructed in the XVIII century &quot;Sundial&quot; is located in the regular lime park. There are 24 linden trees  on the open space, whose age ranges from 110-120 to 175-180 years.
 The regular park, located to the east from the main house, is part of a regular linden park. According to the age of the trees the park was founded in the beginning of the XIX century. This part of the park with the main house, outbuildings, and a flower parterre constitutes palace and park ensemble.
     Originally the park had another planning, from a small circular area located on the main avenue the radial alleys got started, which, combined with the alleys from the wings, formed quite dense system of pathways. The trees were planted alone this pathways. Today, the original plan of the park is mostly lost, but one still can see the rows of old lime trees.
     The most regular tree of the park is a small-leaved lime. Most of the trees are  nearly 120-180 years old, but the age of some oldest trees (there are nearly 20 of them), which are situated in different parts of the park – is over 200-240 years.</div>
