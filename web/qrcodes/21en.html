The entrance gate. The main yard.</h3><div class='field-item'><img src ='/images/21.1.jpg' width='384'></div><div>The Imperial alley (1790s-1816) was paved from the Moscow tract to the estate center throw  the picturesque Bikova grove, it’s partly preserved to present day (starts from the modern Ilinskoe highway). Straight alley marks main North-South axis, which plays dominating role in the main yard, Palace, adjoining terraces and regular park's design.
 The alley leads to the Main arch – entrance to the palace complex (by S. Melnikov, 1817), it is a triumphal arc decorated with columns, graceful images of winged genius of glory and a massive gable.  Tracery cast-iron wings of the gates are made upon the Empire style. One can see a massive white-stone portico through the arch. The main yard is framed by  white-stone colonnades (1815-1816), which were used as passageways to the Palace wings (by French architect Gern, S. Melnikov, V. Strijakov, 1780-1790s, 1815; rebuilt in 1934), which in their turn were connected with the Main arch. Originally there was a kitchen in the eastern wing and home theater with a library in the western one. Rounded corners of the wings, form of the walls and round flowerbed repeats the turn line of old carriages and centers architectural space. 
 In the first half of the XIX century a big sour orange tree was put in the flowerbed in summertime, small trees were located by paired columns on the both sides of the yard. Frescoes on the walls imitated forest background around the complex.</div>
