It was constructed in 1909 – 1916 by the last owners Zinaida and Felix Yusupov in memory of their son Nikolas who lost his duel and died 22 of June 1908. Such kind of building is not typical to Russian architecture of the beginning of the XX century.
 It is built in neo-classic style upon the project of R. Klein's, the famous Moscow architector. Yusupov burial vault  is located in south-eastern part of the park near  the old Church of Archangel Michael, the vault  is situated on the place of former barley building. One can find some similarities between the Yusupov burial vault and St. Peter's Basilica in Rome or Kazan Cathedral in Petersburg: centrally-planned building with portico, dome, rounded collonade wings and  balustrade around an oval ground.
 Foundation works started in spring 1909. 
 Internal space of the vault is divided in 3 levels: top level is a Saint Nicholas's church with a chancel apse; on the ground level there is a burial vault (similar to a chapel); and a “crypt” (burial chamber) on the lowest level . The top interior is magnificently ornamented with vegetative and geometric frescos with some elements of religious Christian art (angels, cherubs,  crosses) and fretwork. The lower interior is treated in monochromatic and geometric style. Accurate proportions create unique acoustics of the interior.
 In 1912 the facade and the interior were redecorated. Klein's student, Grigory Brahinin, executed the works on constructing the bas-relief from a drawing by Klein.
 Craftsmen Gladkov and Kozlov worked with sculptures and fretwork details on building facade, bas-reliefs on the dome drum, colomn caps, they undertook works on redecoration of the cornice and portico. Interior fretwork details were made by craftsmen of the first Moscow sculpture and fretwork workshop. Moscow firm “Artur Perks and co” laid the floor with multicolored tiles (made of marble crumb) upon Klein's drawing.
 In 1913 Klein invited famous expert of monumental-decorative arts Ignatiy Nivinskiy to draw frescoes. The works have not been finished because of the First World War started in 1914 and the Russian Revolution in 1917. Yusupov family at first had to emigrate to Italy and then to France. So, the vault have never been used.
 Today the building is used as an open storage of the large-scaled picture of Jusupov family's collection and also as an exhibition hall.</div>
