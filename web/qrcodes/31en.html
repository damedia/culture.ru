Rotunda was constructed among  bosquets to the East from Big parterre in the middle of the XIX century. In the center of the arbor one can find the fountain with statuary  “Boy with a goose”.
 “Pink fountain” is one of the architectural marks of Regular park. The fountain and the Alexander I Column located on the opposite side of the Big parterre represent East-West line.
Arkhangelskoye park combines such qualities as comprehensiveness and splendor, natural and clear simplicity, immensity, proportionality, proximity and intelligibility – this is the characteristic feature of the estate. Many different ideas of the Yusupov family were embodied in the park: on estate plan of 1818 one can find that there was a poultry yard, or aviary, on one of the bosquets (to the west from the Pink fountain). It was a decorative house with carved roofing and various details. There were different types of birds in it: american crows, cranes, pheasants, peacocks, turkeys, pigeons and Astrakhan ducks. Five swan were brought here from Rakitnaya village. Few years later the aviary was reinstalled in one of the surrounding groves. The aviary and the small zoo, which was installed to the east from the estate, have existed for a long time. In that zoo Yusupov family kept camels and llamas from the Tsarskoye Selo park, that animals were donated to N. Yusupov by the emperor. Deer were also kept there.</div>
