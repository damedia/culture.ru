The street was a part of a road from Zaharkovo village to Voronki village. Arkhangelskoe's part of this road had an appearance of an avenue with lindens on both sides, in the north was a building of the cloth factory (by E. Tyurin 1819-1820) and the “Bakery” (both of them have not been preserved to present day), the “Barley yard” with a hotel (“The house for visitors”), barn, hay's and carriage's shed (are not prevented), office wing, “the barn at the ravine”, servant's wings and workshops (have not been prevented to present day). In 1824-1825 E. Tyurin constructed “Saint gates” on the southern side of the street near the estate's entrance. On the both sides of an alley in the old church of Archangel Michael there was a peasant's hospital and a house for churchmen (have not been preserved to present day). Small wooden towers on the roofs of some buildings (by Joseph Bové, in 1816, have not been preserved to present day) made it to look like a small pleasant town.</div>
