Nature and man-made groves of “english” park evolve into natural forest and frame panorama.
 The regular park is symmetrically designed, it has main North – South axis and forms a system of of straight lines and geometric figures. The park has developed landscape architecture system: huge (240x70m.) grass rectangle of the Big parterre; “bosquets” – small groves of lawn surrounded by oval or square cropped lindens;  “berso” arch galleries with trees grown in trellis cages and long espaliers of trees planted in compact ranks. 
 In the center of the northern part of the parterre one can see a fountain (1820s, “Cupid and swan” sculpture), In the southern part there is a pair of  Borghese “Gladiators” (after antique original). The main axis from North to South was marked with memorial sculptures of Alexander II (1860) and Nicholas II (1896, both have not been preserved). There is the last architectural terrace to the south from the Big parterre and a descent which leads to the groves and river meadow. To the south from the Palace one can see a magnificent view of the old  course of The Moskva River and a landscape of Lohin island on the other side of the river. Earlier there were two stove-houses, Pomerancevskaya and Lavrovaya (have not been preserved to present day), with rear collections of plants. Today there are sanatorium buildings (by V. Apishkov, 1934).</div>
