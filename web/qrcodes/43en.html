Two-floor wings on the main yard,  built in 1771-1772, originally were small and identical. They were built in classicism style without order elements. In 1830 entry halls were added to these buildings, lower windows’ proportions were changed. Later buildings’ exterior was simplified. The western wing, which was built in 1772 better preserved the original architecture’s characteristics. It’s faces doesn’t have composition centre,  they proportionally divides by vertical parts, formed by lower and top windows’ linears connections. Now the building has new design, but arched storeroom and entry hall with wooden stairs, walls  and  dome lamp’s decoration by panel, like in the main house are still remaining.
Now the building houses scientific department of the Museum. After restoration it will house the exhibition with estate’s history after 1917.</div>
