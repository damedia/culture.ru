IndexDescription: These are places that speak to the heart of every Russian, and where you want to return again and again. Virtual tours that can in real time bring you to almost anywhere in Russia, its cultural centers, remind us that our country has been and remains a great power, and Russian spirituality, Russian word and Russian culture is not just a pretty picture. They are symbols of Russia - our cultural heritage, the origins of our culture.
